The HTML file is Horiseon's homepage, modified to meet accessibility standars. It contains semantic HTML elements following a logical structure. All images have been given alt attributes, and a concise, descriptive title has been added. All links in the navigation bar are now working correctly.

In the assests folder, you will find the CSS style sheet, which has been organized and commented to match the flow of the HTML document. Additionally, you will find all of the images shown on the homepage.

Below is a screenshot of the website.
